		# The former will be saved to disk with a file extension of 'gz' and the command 'gunzip <file name on disk>' will be executed (note the %e placeholder).
		# The latter will be saved to disk with a file extension of 'fs' and no command will be executed.
		# These rules will be ignored if there were previous rules with the same match string.
		bw.extractor.add_rule(['gzip compressed data:gz:gunzip %e', 'filesystem:fs'])

		# Load the extraction rules from the default extract.conf file(s).
		bw.extractor.load_defaults()

		# Run the binwalk scan.
